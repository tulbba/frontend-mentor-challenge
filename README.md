# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Comments

I made a lot of changes to the code, because I wasn't happy how the outcome looked especially on mobile. I pretty rewrote almost all of the code, but this time I didn't use Bootstrap, instead I used flexbox. I managed to decline the amount of rows in my SCSS file from about 300 to 130! That was pretty cool. I'm quite late to the CSS flexbox game, learning to use it more only now while I've been learning to code slowly for about a year now. But I think I'm making process and I'm really motivated to learning more and more.
